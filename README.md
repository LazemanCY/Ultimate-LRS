# Ultimate-LRS
My hardware design for 433MHz Ultimate LRS modules.<br />
ULRS project details please refer to http://www.itluxembourg.lu/site/ultimate-lrs/<br />
Work files are under Altium Designer 15.1. <br />
It works with 100mW RFM22 module.<br />
Warning!!! In this design, CP2102 only get power from USB port, while it's unpowered, it could cause strange result. So CP2102 should be removed, sorry
