# Ultimate-LRS
My hardware design for 433MHz Ultimate LRS modules.<br />
ULRS project details please refer to http://www.itluxembourg.lu/site/ultimate-lrs/<br />
Work files are under Altium Designer 15.1. <br />
LazeLink-LITE is low power version, it works with 100mW RFM22 module.<br />
LazeLink-S has RFM23 which gives 1W power.<br />
