# Ultimate-LRS
My hardware design for 433MHz Ultimate LRS modules.<br />
ULRS project details please refer to http://www.itluxembourg.lu/site/ultimate-lrs/<br />
Work files are under Altium Designer 15.1. <br />
LazeLink-LITE is low power version, it works with 100mW RFM22 module. It has a good performance within 5km with Moxon TX antenna. <br />
However, it has a bug: you'd better to remove its CP2102 chip for RX module when using telemetry. <br />
LazeLink-S has RFM23 which gives 1W power.<br />
Feel free to use these file for DIY or commercial purpose.<br />
